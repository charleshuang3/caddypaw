# Product Context

## Problem Solved
Providing authentication and firewall capabilities for the Caddy web server.

## How it Works
CaddyPAW acts as an OAuth/OIDC client, storing JWT tokens in server cookies for authentication. It supports OIDC login flows with a configurable callback URL. It also integrates with a firewall to ban IP addresses upon attack detection.
